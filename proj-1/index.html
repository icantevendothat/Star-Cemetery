        <p> The above graphic is a visual representation of New York City's Daily Inmates in Custody. The brightest stars are those with the latest addmittance dates, and get darker the longer an inmate is imprisoned. The biggest stars represent inmates who are in minimum security prisons, whereas the smallest stars represent maximum security inmates.
        Although every victim of a crime deserves justice, The United States of America relies heavily on carceral punishment, and has let the problem run so rampant, that now it is the picture of mass incarceration. The effects of our justice system disproporitonately affects communities of color, as evidenced by the bar at the top, where you can see inmates' races as you hover over each star. Being incarcerated has many more consequences than just a life lost to obsoletion. Being incarcerated leads to poor physical, psychological, and economic outcomes for the people who experience imprisonment, for their families, as well as for the broader community. It also effects employment upon release, securing housing, and most importantly, the rate of recidivism seen in incarcerated populations.
